            <p>This first example is a collection of some practice problems I did using regex (regular expressions). 
                Regex is used to match and/or grab certain parts of a file. In this case, it was used to grab correctly 
                formatted URLs and to parse invoices</p>

        <div class="work_samples">
            <p>This next example is a collection of some practice problems I did using Ruby's HTTParty. The purpose of HTTParty
                is to grab data from an API, convert that data into a JSON file, then parse that file for whatever information
                you need.

        <div class="work_samples">
            <p>This final example is a collection of some practice problems I did on Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in Ruby. Learning
                OOP in an easy-to-read programming language like Ruby is crucial to more easily understand larger projects and break them
                down into smaller classes / parts.
